First, we analyze the growth of the projects during its life-cycle. We measure the lines of code, number of commented lines, the number of directories, the number of functions,statements and complexity. 

Second, we analyze the characteristics of the project in terms of time to ship new releases and how frequently public APIs change. This is an important factor to understand, due to the development nature of the language, which is highly modular and fast passed. JavaScript libraries are created, shared and combined with other JavaScripts libraries with a hight frequency and often they are modified to fit a specific purpose. This is a reflexion of the dynamic environment that the language is mostly used. We examine the release density of five projects which has different release policies. 

Third, we conduct a quantitative study on how JavaScript community gets involved with the project development. We discuss the relation between the number of developers in different periods of the project and the number of issues that are reported and fixed. Then we analyze the average time that it takes to fix an issue over the different JavaScript projects and explore the how the engagement and availability of developers combined impacts the evolution of the project. 

Fourth, we inspect bad practices in the source code and anti-patterns, also know as bad smells. We quantify the different kind of faults that were found during the evolution of the projects and sort them by its severity: blocker, critical, major, minor and info. There are more than 75 rules to classify a piece of code as an fault. We found that there are some bad smells that are specific for the JavaScript language and that that are other that has the same concept applied to statically typed languages.

More specidically we want to analyze first, the growth of JavaScript projects. Second, the time to release new versions and how frequently the functions in JavaScript changes. Third, how actevelly developers from the open source community colaborates to the projects and what is the average time to fix a bug in these projects. Forth, How common it is to have bad practices and anti-patterns in JavaScript projects. In order to do that we use the collected data from 15 open source projects as described in our approach to anwser our research questions.
