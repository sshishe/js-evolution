\everton{ use this paragraph in the related work for JavaScript. Note that it was just measuring metrics not evolution. but we have to mention it: 
	Starts here:
	Previous works on JavaScript calculate trivial metrics such as number of attributes (NOA), number of methods (NOM), Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT) and number of children. Possible actions can be taken for: (1) recalculating and evaluating those metrics, (2) calculating advanced metric complexity of a function or file. }
