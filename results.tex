To summarize the distance between first and last release of each project we use different metrics based on Table \ref{tab:metrics_definition} metrics and list them in Table ??????. 
As we can see Brackets first release contains 6271 lines of code but it ends up with 266801 lines of code in the last release. Bracket's last release is the most biggest evolved project with in four years of its existence.
