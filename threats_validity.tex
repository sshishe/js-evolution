Moreover, all of the projects that we select are either server side codes or they are client side libraries for enhancement of development in client side web applications. But we did not take it into account to have JavaScript codes that are part of the web application. The results from client site codes which are not part of client libraries can reflect different behavior than what we observe on our selected dataset.
