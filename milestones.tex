By the end of March 17th we will finish the data extraction from the tools that we had prepared (SonarQube and JSDeodorant).
We will need one week to analyze the data and use it in R Studio, where we will do statistical analysis and plot the evolution graphs. By the end of the March we will be able to assert the results from our analysis and start writing the final report. To be as precise as we can, we need two more weeks for writing the report and at more few days for fixing probable mistakes that we made in our statistical analysis accordingly with received feedbacks from Professor Shihab.
