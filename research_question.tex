\begin{itemize}
	\item How and in what extent can we measure object oriented metrics in JavaScript?
	\item  By admitting the fact that JavaScript developers emulate object oriented style programming, we can empirically compare the differences between this language and mainstream programming languages.
	\item Studying the evolution of JavaScript libraries in terms of software metrics to find out how mature developers are writing code in terms of obeying object oriented best practices.
\end{itemize}
